Repository: Config
==================

This is the repository for my configuration for all linux computers. It contains mostly generally useful tools that are useful for any setup. There are some dot files for configuration purposes but mostly there are the scripts in the bin directory.

To make sure the repository is easily included into the setup an install script is provided to ease the adaptation of the repository and at the same time keep it available for synchronization with the github repository.

Install the Config package into your account. The starting point is a "git clone" of the Config

     git clone https://github.com/cpausmit/Config

The last step is to install all pieces in place with

     ./Config/Configure.sh
