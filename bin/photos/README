WARNING -- right now as the location of the scripts have changed not all is working.

Tools for dealing with our family photos.

Presentation
------------

Our basic presentation system is a flashbased program called simpleviewer around which I have written a number of perl/bash scripts to keep things in order. Probably the most important point is to keep the original photos and at the same time have a lower quality copy that will be sufficicent for the display on the screen but fast enough not to flood the network. The basic idea is that all photos are stored in a simple year/month directory structure in which each photo file has a unique name constructed fromt he date and time and the camera model. So far this has turned out to be quite effective and it is straight forward to search with the amount of photos we have.

The second, smaller copy of photos is automatically generated byt he scripts and then fed to the simpleviewer program to make the galleries. An index file is created and automatically linked into the simpleviewer configuration.


Camera Downloads
----------------

SSHelper

Make sure your cell phone is connected to the same wireless network (dragocolositito) that your computer to which you download is connected to.

Start the SSHelper application on the phone. Check it is working and find the IP address and port (2222) to be used for the download.

  export USER=paus
  export IP=192.168.X.X

  cd /home/paus/Pictures/$USER
  ssh $IP -p 2222 du -sh SDCard/DCIM/*
  scp -r -P 2222 $IP:SDCard/DCIM ./

  check whether complete:
    [ slow: rsync -Cavz -e "ssh -p 2222" $IP:SDCard/DCIM ]
    ssh -p 2222 $IP ls -1 SDCard/DCIM/Camera > phone.list
    ls                           DCIM/Camera > disk.list
    diff disk.list phone.list

  remove photos from phone:
    ssh $IP -p 2222
    rm SDCard/DCIM/*/*

  order them into our album
    orderPhotos.py --path /home/paus/Pictures/$USER --model $USER


Older versions

Each camera has a custom script which will automatically download all photos and movies to store the originals and generate the second copy. Also a backup copy is automatically generated.

orderPhotos.py --path ./Pictures --model Others
orderPhotos.py --path ./rsync/Ana --model Ana-S9
orderPhotos.py --path ./rsync/paus --model Christoph-S9
