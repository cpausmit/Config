Tools for dealing with our family photos.

Our basic presentation system is a flashbased program called simpleviewer around which I have written a number of perl/bash scripts to keep things in order. Probably the most important point is to keep the original photos and at the same time have a lower quality copy that will be sufficicent for the display on the screen but fast enough not to flood the network. The basic idea is that all photos are stored in a simple year/month directory structure in which each photo file has a unique name constructed fromt he date and time and the camera model. So far this has turned out to be quite effective and it is straight forward to search with the amount of photos we have.

The second, smaller copy of photos is automatically generated byt he scripts and then fed to the simpleviewer program to make the galleries. An index file is created and automatically linked into the simpleviewer configuration.

Each camera has a custom script which will automaticallyt download all photos and movies to store the originals and generate the second copy. Also a backup copy is automatically generated.
